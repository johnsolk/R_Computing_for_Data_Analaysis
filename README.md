Week 2: 
1. getmonitor.R - a function named 'getmonitor' that takes three arguments: 'id', 'directory', and 'summarize'. Given a monitor ID number, 'getmonitor' reads that monitor's particulate matter data from the directory specified in the 'directory' argument and returns a data frame containing that monitor's data.
2. complete.R - a function that reads a directory full of files and reports a data frame with the number of completely observed cases in each data file. 
3. corr.R - a function that takes a directory of data files and a threshold for complete cases and calculates the correlation between sulfate and nitrate for monitor locations where the number of completely observed cases (on all variables) is greater than the threshold.
